The "inch by inch" concept refers to RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks) configurations that improve performance, redundancy, or both by using multiple hard drives. Below is a textual representation of different RAID levels:

### **RAID 0 (Striping)**
- **Purpose**: Performance
- **Description**: Data is split evenly across two or more disks, increasing performance by allowing simultaneous read/write operations on multiple disks.
- **Number of Disks**: Minimum 2
- **Storage Efficiency**: 100%
- **Fault Tolerance**: None (if one disk fails, all data is lost)

```
Data 1 | Data 2 | Data 3 | Data 4
Disk 1 | Disk 2 | Disk 1 | Disk 2
```

### **RAID 1 (Mirroring)**
- **Purpose**: Redundancy
- **Description**: Data is mirrored (duplicated) across two or more disks, providing redundancy. If one disk fails, the data can still be accessed from the other.
- **Number of Disks**: Minimum 2
- **Storage Efficiency**: 50% (only half of the total storage is usable due to mirroring)
- **Fault Tolerance**: High (data is still available if one disk fails)

```
Data 1 | Data 1
Disk 1 | Disk 2
```

### **RAID 5 (Striping with Parity)**
- **Purpose**: Performance + Redundancy
- **Description**: Data is striped across multiple disks, and parity (error-checking data) is stored across the disks to provide redundancy. Parity data allows data to be rebuilt if one disk fails.
- **Number of Disks**: Minimum 3
- **Storage Efficiency**: (N-1)/N, where N is the number of disks
- **Fault Tolerance**: Can tolerate one disk failure

```
Data 1 | Data 2 | Parity
Disk 1 | Disk 2 | Disk 3

Data 3 | Parity | Data 4
Disk 2 | Disk 3 | Disk 1
```

### **RAID 10 (1+0, Mirrored Stripes)**
- **Purpose**: Performance + Redundancy
- **Description**: Combines RAID 1 and RAID 0. Data is mirrored, and the mirrored sets are then striped for increased performance.
- **Number of Disks**: Minimum 4
- **Storage Efficiency**: 50%
- **Fault Tolerance**: Can tolerate one disk failure per mirrored set

```
Data 1 | Data 2 | Data 1 | Data 2
Disk 1 | Disk 2 | Disk 3 | Disk 4
```

### **RAID 6 (Striping with Double Parity)**
- **Purpose**: Performance + Redundancy
- **Description**: Similar to RAID 5 but with two sets of parity data, allowing for protection against two disk failures.
- **Number of Disks**: Minimum 4
- **Storage Efficiency**: (N-2)/N, where N is the number of disks
- **Fault Tolerance**: Can tolerate two disk failures

```
Data 1 | Parity | Data 2 | Parity
Disk 1 | Disk 2 | Disk 3 | Disk 4

Data 3 | Data 4 | Parity | Data 5
Disk 2 | Disk 3 | Disk 4 | Disk 1
```

These are the basic RAID levels and their textual representation, with each configuration tailored to provide a different balance of performance, storage efficiency, and redundancy.
