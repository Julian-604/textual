### 3. **Guidelines for Filling Out the Worksheet**:

1. **Task Description**: Write a short but clear description of each task you plan to work on throughout the day.
   
2. **Priority**: Use a simple classification like **High**, **Medium**, or **Low** to denote the urgency or importance of each task.

3. **Start and End Times**: Record the time you start and finish each task to help track how much time you're spending on each task.

4. **Duration**: Calculate the time spent on each task. For example:
   - If you start at 9:00 AM and finish at 10:30 AM, the duration is 1.5 hours.
   
5. **Status**: Update the status at the end of the day or after completion of each task. Common statuses:
   - **Completed**: Task finished as expected.
   - **In Progress**: Task is underway but not completed.
   - **Pending**: Task has not yet started or requires more time.

6. **Notes**: Write down any observations, challenges, or details about the task. This section is useful for reflecting on your work and noting important points for future tasks.

7. **Next Steps**: List any follow-up actions required for the task or for tomorrow.

8. **Category**: This helps in grouping your tasks by type (e.g., Work-related, Personal tasks, Meetings, Learning, etc.).

### 5. **Additional Tips**:
- **Time Blocking**: Schedule specific times for each task to stay focused and efficient.
- **Daily Review**: At the end of each day, review your worksheet to assess your progress and prepare for the next day.
- **Automate Reminders**: Set up reminders (via apps or digital assistants) to stay on track with deadlines and meetings.
